Symfony Demo Application
========================

Usage
-----

Thanks to Symfony demo app, there's no need to configure anything to run the application.

```
➜  symfony-docker-js-routing-demo git:(master) ✗ make
build  Build local images
run    Launch local
down   Stop & remove local
```

Then access the application in your browser at the given URL (<https://localhost:9080> by default).
